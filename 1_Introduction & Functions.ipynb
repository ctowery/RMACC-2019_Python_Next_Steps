    "First a disclaimer, this class is actually designed for two, two hour sessions. having said that by the end you will still accomplish, at least conceptually, all the content of the full four hours of material!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Goals**: The intended goal of the first section is to learn about functions in the aspect of Object Oriented Design (OOD) and Programming (OOP). This will lead us into classes. Along the way we will explore all kinds of other  Python magical tools, tips and tricks. Some you may have heard of or seen in passing and I'm hoping some cool stuff brand new to you!\n",

    "The second, and not barely included,section digs much deeper into the rules of classes including more on subclassing, multiple file applications along with the creation of packages and modules, callback functions via signals and slots, and other built-in class functions all while learning who to quickly and easily build PyQt base GUI's for applications. It wraps up, and this last section is included, with profiling, speed improvements and an introduction on how to think of ways to cheat faults in code design using other Python features, in this case using static and class methods. \n",

    "## Object Oriented (OO) Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "The orientation of the following terms is centered on the concept of designing/constructing code that acts on a set of data to produce a new set of data derived from the original including extending, subsetting, joining multiple datasets, describing the original data as new data (e.q. mathematical transformations) or as a graphical interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object:** Potentially any coded constructed (at least in Python). Examples of objects can be variable, a function, a class, a succinct block of memory (usually in RAM but this concept can be extended to a block of memory in certain file structures such as those in HDF5 and netCDF), a data structure, ect...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Oriented Design (OOD):** OOD is the process of designing a solution to a software problem, either a full program (or script) or a component used in one. The process is centered around the creation and interaction of interacting objects. In the ideal world (usually non-practical in the production world) each object is 100% self contained and prevents unauthorized and 'non-clean' intrusions of data in or out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Oriented Programming (OOP):** The use of applying a programming language to physically construct the design laid out from and OOD process. More specifically it is the application of using, or creating, a languages objects to create the OOD specified methods (e.g classes, functions, ect) driven by a set of attributes (eg variables, data-structures, other methods/method instances). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes:** The variables or variable instances (of other variables, data-structures, or even methods) used to describe a an active feature of inside a method. Most often thought of as a ***'class variable'*** which is synonymous with the term ***'class member'***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class:** A OOD designed prototype created as the core base in an OOP process that defines all the attributes and methods that characterize the desired object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance/Subclassing:** Inheritance is the ability to create a new class that inherits both the attributes and methods from another class. The class to be inherited from is known as the *'super class'* (also referred to as a *'base class'*, or *'parent class'*) The new class is usually referred to as the *'child class'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instantiation:** The act of create an *'instance'* of a class. This is usually seen as creating a variable as an 'object' representing that class. A class can be instantiated by many instance, each unique from the others. however each instance can only represent one unique object/class at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method:** Basically today we will just refer to methods as functions defined within a class object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overloading/overriding:** The ability to create more then one function for a given operation. For instance creating a base class with an 'add' function to add two scalars. You then create a subclass off the base class and now overload/overwrite 'add' so it can add to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are pages and pages of other important terminology you should explore to become truly proficient programmers but this 'should' suffice for todays material."

The trick now is to learn to create the rich toolsets you need derived from the OO tools Python so extremely richly provides us with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact everything in Python is object based and the interfaces to all those objects are so transparent that there are all kinds of magical things you can do, many of which are sheer coincidental accidents but ohhh so cool. You will actually make miraculous use of such a 'happy accident' today!\n"

Worse then that it will vary from project to project. If you find yourself working in the production coding world and you start a new project one of the very first things you should ask is to read the 'styles' guide. Thats assuming (and you know the old adage on \"assuming\" they have one. In lack of that make sure you sit down with someone to learn their 'style' of coding and then make sure you adopt it!!!<br>\n",

I do a lot of coding in c/c++ and Fortran so I'm highly partial to making my Python code look like my other code unless theres extreme advantages of going 'more' pythonic and we will have need of that later. The advantage is if I find I want/need to convert it to c/c++ its vastly easier. Cons, if I'm working with, or in some form sharing, my code with Python purists that insist all things be purely Pythonic else it's garbage (OK they are not that extreme at all but---) then conversations can get highly 'personal' and its best to leave things at that."

We are not going to really dig into this important concept but if you pay attention you will see it in action in everything you do. It's basic rules should be understood in heavier programming as when you go to debug python, or other, programs you will find that scope is a major cause of many problems you will create, err encounter.<br>\n",
