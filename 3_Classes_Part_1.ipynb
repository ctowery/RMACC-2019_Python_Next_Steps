These classes are mutable thanks to a process often, at least in the c/c++ worlds, as *aliasing*, yet they hold immutable data members. \n",

When you create a new class object in Python it defaults to inheriting from the Object class. What that means is that object has all kinds of cool methods under its hood and when you create your new class its literally a '*child*' of it's '*parent*' class - object. \n",

    "HOWEVER, the story does not end there. Your class does not have to be a generic object child class. It can inherit from any class you desire (sort of). In fact most kids I know have more then one parent and likewise classes can be subclassed from multiple classes all at the same time. This is where the real power in programming comes into play. But with all real power comes real dangers. Happily, as long as you have a decent map of the class terrain you want to tread one you can usually plot a safe course. \n",

Since the lab I (err you) are working for is an independent, third party medical/pharmaceutical testing facility and thus you fall under the torture, err guidance of the FDA. So you have a controller class which will automatically adjust the temperature for you. The FDA states, and they are VERY strict on these things, that the refrigerator must maintain a temperature of 4 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C. Any deviation is a violation and requires instant and drastic measures.\n",
    "So some total idiot (not me at least point) writes the controller code and uses integers in the controller code within the LIMS system. You (OK it was me) writes the code that monitors the actual thermometer reading that gets dumped into the controller and wisely you (sorry, still me) uses floats. So all is great in the initial testing for some reason. Then a few months later a rather major company comes in for an audit and see the readings from the thermometer is almost a half degree over the limit and yet is not creating an all important error broadcast. All hell now breaks out because Bloody Mary (seriously thats what she was known as) from the FDA is on the way over and a nuclear blast directly on top of your head would be vastly funner.\n",
